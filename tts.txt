MicroCast Radio, your weekly look at online culture in Morocco.

Tonight: Hi-sham Mel-loo-lee is widely known online as a loud, high-energy influencer, often associated with fitness, motivation, and street-style talk. Hi-sham Mel-loo-lee built attention through short clips and live moments where everything feels immediate.

Now, the part many listeners ask about: the social media triangle often mentioned with Hi-sham Mel-loo-lee, Nah-da Ha-see, and Nizar Sbiti.

In the press, Nah-da Ha-see and Nizar Sbiti became a headline couple, and their relationship story also spilled into public live streams and arguments. In April 2021, reports said Nah-da Ha-see and Nizar Sbiti were arrested in Meknes over an alleged violation of Covid-19 emergency rules during a wedding gathering. Hi-sham Mel-loo-lee was also reported arrested in March 2021 in Tangier for an alleged violation of the same emergency rules.

Later, in early 2022, reports linked Hi-sham Mel-loo-lee and Nizar Sbiti to a separate dispute that reached the courts. The details vary by source, but the pattern is clear: online fame, live drama, and real-world consequences.

This is the MicroCast reminder: enjoy the story, but verify claims, avoid harassment, and remember that algorithms amplify conflict.
